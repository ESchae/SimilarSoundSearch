<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>During this task you will be asked to rate the similarity of short sound snippets.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);"><strong>Definition of Similarity</strong></span></p>

<p>The concept of similarity is a rather vague notion in this task. Hence we are <span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">not searching for exact similarity</span> but rather for results that share some kind of similar aspects with the query. &nbsp;Of course one might find any kind of similarity in everything but this is not the task here. We are rather interested in your spontaneous impression of similarity between sounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two sounds are <span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">defined as similar, if they <u>sound&nbsp;</u>similar in some respects</span> ("acoustical similarity"). &nbsp;</p>

<p>You &nbsp;must <span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">n</span><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">ot take account of similarities of the sound producing event</span> for your similarity rating.</p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p><strong>Similar:</strong></p>

	<audio controls="controls">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		<source src="https://www.freesound.org/data/previews/165/165116_1037961-lq.ogg" type="audio/ogg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</p>

<p>
	<audio controls="controls">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</p>

<p>sounds of food frying vs. rain falling: &nbsp;sounding similar (even without similarities of the sound producing event)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Not Similar:</strong></p>

<p>
	<audio controls="controls">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		<source src="http://www.freesound.org/data/previews/251/251489_1118942-lq.ogg" type="audio/ogg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		<source src="http://www.freesound.org/data/previews/251/251489_1118942-lq.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</audio>
</p>

<p>
	<audio controls="controls">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		<source src="http://www.freesound.org/data/previews/319/319346_3625175-lq.ogg" type="audio/ogg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</p>

<p>sounds of human cough vs. &nbsp;laugher: do not sound similar (even though the sound producing event (human) is similar)</p>

<p><strong>Boundary case:</strong></p>

<p>
	<audio controls="controls">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		<source src="http://www.freesound.org/data/previews/242/242009_4401185-lq.ogg" type="audio/ogg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</p>

<p>
	<audio controls="controls">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</p>

<p>sounds of a human scream vs. buzzard scream: they share some acoustic similarities (e.g. pitch perceivable and even similar pitch, comparable repetitive structure), but they also are not as similar as the first example - the decision is up to you whether or not you would rate them as similar</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In every task you have to fulfil the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;Listen &nbsp;to the &nbsp;sound files. Best practice would be to listen to the complete file. If you skip parts make sure that you did not miss an important change in the sound quality.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Rate whether the two sounds are acoustically similar or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you finished, please take the time to answer 7 short questions of a survey (max. 30 seconds). You can find it &nbsp;<a href="https://de.surveymonkey.com/r/YCN36Y5" target="_blank">here</a> .&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Thank you!</h1>

<p>Your similarity ratings will be used to get refined relevance scores for an improved search engine for similar sounding sounds, that is able to deal better with the vague notion of similarity between sounds. Thank you for your hard work!</p>
